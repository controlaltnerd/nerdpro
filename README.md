  <p align="center">
   Customized theme for my personal site.
  </p>

NerdPro is a theme for Hugo based on [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) (itself based on [hugo-paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper)).

This project is mainly intended as a learn-in-public development effort, and to customize and extend the theme for my own site.

That being said, I'm always keen to learn something new, so feel free to contribute! Keep in mind that because this is the theme for my own site, I might not incorporate every idea that is suggested, but I'm happy to listen and learn at the very least.

If you want to know more about the theme's inner workings, check out [adityatelange's](https://github.com/adityatelange/) [demo site](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/), where they used the hugo-PaperMod theme to build a documentation site about the theme itself. Most of the information in those docs should be relevant, though you will likely find more deviations over time as I change things in NerdPro.
